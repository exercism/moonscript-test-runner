# Exercism MoonScript Test Runner

The Docker image to automatically run tests on MoonScript solutions submitted to [Exercism].

## Run the test runner

To run the tests of a single solution, do the following:

1. Open a terminal in the project's root
2. Run `bin/run.moon ${exercise_slug} ${solution_dir} ${output_dir}`

Once the test runner has finished, its results will be written to `${output_dir}/results.json`.

## Run the test runner on a solution using Docker

_This script is provided for testing purposes, as it mimics how test runners run in Exercism's production environment._

To run the tests of a single solution using the Docker image, do the following:

1. Open a terminal in the project's root
2. Run `./bin/run-in-docker.sh ${exercise_slug} ${solution_dir} ${output_dir}`

Once the test runner has finished, its results will be written to `${output_dir}/results.json`.

## Run the tests

To run the tests to verify the behavior of the test runner, do the following:

1. Open a terminal in the project's root
2. Run `./bin/run-tests.sh`

These are [golden tests][golden] that compare the `results.json` generated by running the current state of the code against the "known good" `tests/${test_name}/expected_results.json`. All files created during the test run itself are discarded.

When you've made modifications to the code that will result in a new "golden" state, you'll need to update the affected `tests/${test_name}/expected_results.json` file(s).

## Benchmarking

**_NOTE: not implemented_**

There are two scripts you can use to benchmark the test runner:

1. `./bin/benchmark.sh`: benchmark the test runner code
2. `./bin/benchmark-in-docker.sh`: benchmark the Docker image

These scripts can give a rough estimation of the test runner's performance.
Bear in mind though that the performance on Exercism's production servers is often lower.
